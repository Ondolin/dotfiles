# Dotfiles of Ondolin

This repository contains the dotfiles for several CLI tools I use.

## Requirements

### Vim setup

- [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim)
- [Vimplug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

### Shell

- ZSH
- [Oh my ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/#install)

### Other scripts

- [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa)


## Optional stuff

- [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)

## Installation

Currently there are two supported package managers (apt and pacman). Brew will follow in the near future.

To install the required programs and some configs for them run the following commands:

1. `sudo sh ./install.sh`
2. `sudo sh ./install_zsh_config.sh`

WARNING: Make sure you save your old config files before the get overwritten.
